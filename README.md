# MediaPipe and OpenCV
This repository contains mediapipe and opencv project,I have created hand tracking and pose module differently so as to import it in the project easily
- Virtual Painter: With the hand movements we can draw on the screens having 3 basic colours RGB with a Eraser to rub
  
- Ai Trainer: This project would be loved by gym enthusiasts because with this we can have a track of number of reps for biceps curls and also this made sure we do a proper curl from low to high.
  
- Virtual Mouse: We can control the mouse of the system using hand tracking with 2 finger we can click on the screen.
  
- Volume Control: We can change the system volume in real time with the help of the thumb and index finger.
  
- Finger Counting: We can count from 0 to 5 using hand tracking also displays the corresponding image
